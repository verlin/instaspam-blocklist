# instaspam-blocklist
A repository of keywords for blocking comment spam on Instagram

## What is this?
If you're on Instagram, you already know that one of the worst things about the platform is comment spammers. They have a very particular modus operandi - they follow popular hashtags or accounts and comment on everything with a come-on to get you to visit or DM another account (never the one making the comment). If you fall for it, the sales pitches and offers for "paid promotion" start. These are overwhelmingly scams of one form or another, but Instagram's post/comment reporting tools don't do an effective job of weeding out these bad actors because when you report the spam, Instagram's automated tools take action against the spamming account, not the one being promoted.

There is another way, however. Instagram allows you to filter comments on your posts via keyword. Filtered comments are not visible to you, and most critically, to other people visiting your posts. So if you build a filter containing the scammers' actual accounts, you stop a lot of the spam from coming through. This project aims to crowdsource an effective blocklist for "Instaspam", and share it with others to use.

## Great, how do I use it?
I thought you'd never ask! It's very simple.

1. Download or view the blocklist.txt file that's in this repo.
2. In your Instagram account, on a desktop web browser, click on your profile picture in the upper right hand corner, then click Settings.
3. Click "Privacy and Security".
4. Click "Edit Comment Settings".
5. Paste the entire contents of the blocklist.txt file into the textbox under the "Comment Filtering" heading.
6. Optionally, tick the checkbox labeled "Use Default Keywords". This adds additional filters based on posts and comments you've personally reported to Instagram. I turn this on, you may find that it surpresses some comments you actually want to see.
7. Click "Submit".
8. At this point, you're filtering Instaspam with the best filtering keyword set currently available, but you'll need to keep it up to date. Why not star this repo so you'll know where to come back to? Much appreciated.

## Why is my account on this list?
This list is curated to contain account names that are known to be promoted using comment spam. If you're on this list, it's because one of the project maintainers has actively verified comment spam promoting your account. If you believe you've been added in error, open an issue and a maintainer will investigate and respond.

## Do you have an Instagram?
I do, but I'm not promoting it here. If you would like what I post, chances are you already follow the hashtags I post on. Maybe you already follow me!

## I love it, can I contribute to this list?
Sure - fork the repo and open a pull request. Please do NOT open issues to submit requests to add a new keyword to the list.
